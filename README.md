# Adaptive Assessment and Inclusive Learning Program
The project is a quiz with an adaptive evaluation system that changes its level of difficulty based on the user. The quiz adjusts the difficulty of the questions based on the participant's aptitude. People with disabilities can use **Palm controllers** and **speech recognition** to use this quiz. 


(i) Our concept aims to **_promote overall learning while also assisting anyone with any impairment to effortlessly and independently_** study utilising the quiz, therefore building their confidence. 

(ii) Our quiz consists of three sections: a standard quiz with the ability to vary the level of difficulty; a quiz that may be completed using palm controllers; and a voice recognition quiz.


> DETAILED DESCRIPTION :- 

We have created new ways to interact with the quiz that enables non-technical users and individuals with disabilities to independently participate in the quiz; users can use their hands to enter their responses. The read-out option, is also available for blind persons which reads the question aloud so that they can respond with their hands. Due to automated input and submission, this function is especially helpful for those who are not familiar with computers or keyboards.

For those who are unable to use keyboards, we have incorporated voice recognition as a function. To utilise this feature, we just wait for the "say answer" prompt and afterwards speak our response, like "option 1," "option 2," "option 3," or "option 4." 
The computer records what we intend to say and submits the response automatically. 

With the help of this function, older individuals or those who cannot use a keyboard can take the quiz.







At the end of the quiz, you are given your score as well as information on the number of questions from each difficulty level that you correctly or incorrectly answered. 
Using the question-wise analysis option, you can also evaluate each of your responses separately. Choosing this will bring up a screen with the question, the appropriate response, and the answer you chose.
